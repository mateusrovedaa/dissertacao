abstract = {Employing the Internet of Things (IoT) in healthcare provides many advantages for patient monitoring and analysis of the patient's health with the help of generated data. The basic role of IoT in healthcare is to ease the patient's life by giving them a monitor over their medical condition. The use of IoT in medical devices requires a focus on the end-user. Medical devices such as glucose meters are designed to record the data of the patient and their vital signs. The generated information can be used to enhance decision-making for the physician. The collected information about the patient can be at risk due to certain security issues during the transferring of information can compromise the identity and social life of the patient. This review explores the IoT regarding its structural requirement and its role in various fields with special emphasis on healthcare. The security and privacy issues than can hinder the utilization of IoT at its potential and ways to overcome these issues are being addressed.}

ABSTRACT = {Photoplethysmography (PPG) is an affordable and straightforward optical technique used to detect changes in blood volume within tissue microvascular beds. PPG technology has found widespread application in commercial medical devices, enabling measurements of oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and cardiac output; the assessment of autonomic nerve function; and the diagnosis of peripheral vascular disease. Recently, the growing demand for non-invasive, portable, cost-effective technology, along with advancements in small semiconductor components, has led to the integration of PPG into various wrist-worn wearable devices. Multiple sensor structures have been proposed and, through appropriate signal processing and algorithmic application, these wearable devices can measure a range of health indicators during daily life. This paper begins by addressing the market status of wrist-worn wearable devices, followed by an explanation of the fundamental principles underlying light operation and its interaction with living tissue for PPG measurements. Moving on to technological advancements, the paper addresses the analog front end for the measurement of the PPG signal, sensor configurations with multiple light emitters and receivers, the minimum sampling rate required for low-power systems, and the measurement of stress, sleep, blood pressure, blood glucose, and activity using PPG signals. Several challenges in the field are also identified, including selecting the appropriate wavelength for the PPG sensor’s light source, developing low-power interpolation methods to extract high-resolution inter-beat intervals at a low sampling rate, and exploring the measurement of physiological phenomena using multi-wavelength PPG signals simultaneously collected at the same location. Lastly, the paper presents future research directions, which encompass the development of new, reliable parameters specific to wearable PPG devices and conducting studies in real-world scenarios, such as 24-h long-term measurements.},

In pulse oximetry, the fact that hemoglobin bound with oxygen (called oxyhemoglobin) and hemoglobin without oxygen (deoxy-hemoglobin or reduced hemoglobin) absorb/reflect light differently is exploited in ascertaining, noninvasively, oxygen saturation in arterial blood. Most pulse oximeters that are in existence today use a couple of PPGs obtained using red and infrared wavelength light sources and calculate oxygen saturation in arterial blood using the red and IR PPGs and an empirical equation. This chapter details the development of pulse oximetry. It describes in detail a couple of novel methods of oxygen saturation calculation using the red and IR PPGs.

abstract = {The digital transformation process has significantly boosted the widespread adoption of telemedicine and the utilization of wearable devices for vital signs remote monitoring. However, implementing a system for continuous monitoring of the population’s vital signs, with data being streamed from various locations within a smart city context, faces significant challenges. These challenges are related to bandwidth consumption, communication latency, and storage capacity due to the large volume of data. To overcome these challenges, a common practice consists in modeling an edge-fog-cloud layered architecture. The literature lacks software solutions capable of managing the simultaneous transmission of various vital signs data from geographically distributed individuals while maintaining the ability to generate health notifications promptly. In this context, we propose the VSAC (Vital Sign Adaptive Compressor) model, which combines lossy and lossless data compression algorithms in a layered architecture to support healthcare demands in a smart city. The main contribution is how we blend both strategies: we first use lossy compression to collect only valuable vital sign data for everyone, applying lossless algorithms afterwards to reduce the number of bytes before sending it to higher layers. We provide a real-time processing protocol that facilitates the collection of heterogeneous data distributed across different city regions. After executing a VSAC prototype, the results indicate that orchestrating the aforementioned two data compression algorithms is more efficient than conventional data reduction methods. In particular, we obtained gains of up to 42% when measuring the compression rate metric.}

ABSTRACT = {The aging global population requires innovative remote monitoring systems to assist doctors and caregivers in assessing the health of elderly patients. Doctors often lack access to continuous behavioral data, making it difficult to detect deviations from normal patterns when elderly patients arrive for a consultation. Without historical insights into common behaviors and potential anomalies detected with unobtrusive techniques (e.g., non-wearable devices), timely and informed medical interventions become challenging. To address this, we propose an edge-based Internet of Things (IoT) framework that enables real-time monitoring and anomaly detection using non-wearable sensors to assist doctors and caregivers in assessing the health of elderly patients. By processing data locally, the system minimizes privacy concerns and ensures immediate data availability, allowing healthcare professionals to detect unusual behavioral patterns early. The system employs advanced machine learning (ML) models to identify deviations that may indicate potential health risks. A prototype of our system has been developed to test its feasibility and demonstrate, through the application of two of the most frequently used ML models, i.e., isolation forest and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, that it can provide scalability, efficiency, and reliability in the context of elderly care. Further, the provided dashboard enables caregivers and healthcare professionals to access real-time alerts and longitudinal trends, facilitating proactive interventions. The proposed approach improves healthcare responsiveness by providing instant insights into patient behavior, facilitating more accurate diagnoses and interventions. This study lays the groundwork for future advancements in the field and offers valuable insights for the research community to harness the full potential of combining edge computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and the IoT in elderly care.},

This research introduces a novel AI-driven telemedicine framework that integrates IoMT, cloud computing, and wireless sensor networks for efficient healthcare monitoring. A key innovation of this study is the Transformer-based Self-Attention Model (TL-SAM), which enhances disease classification by replacing conventional convolutional layers with transformer layers. The proposed TL-SAM framework effectively extracts spatial and spectral features from patient health data, optimizing classification accuracy. Furthermore, the model employs an Improved Wild Horse Optimization with Levy Flight Algorithm (IWHOLFA) for hyperparameter tuning, enhancing its predictive performance. Real-time biosensor data is collected and transmitted to an IoMT cloud repository, where AI-driven analytics facilitate early disease diagnosis. Extensive experimentation on the UCI dataset demonstrates the superior accuracy of TL-SAM compared to conventional deep learning models, achieving an accuracy of 98.62{\%}, precision of 97{\%}, recall of 98{\%}, and F1-score of 97{\%}. The study highlights the effectiveness of AI-enhanced IoMT systems in reducing healthcare costs, improving early disease detection, and ensuring timely medical interventions.

  abstract={The rapid growth of the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) has led to challenges in real-time processing, prioritization, and resource allocation of heterogeneous healthcare data. Existing edge-fog-cloud approaches often fail to effectively handle critical medical events and ensure timely interventions. This paper presents a novel IoHT framework that integrates an M/M/C/K priority queue model (M: Markovian arrival/service rates, C: servers, K: capacity) with a three-tier edge-fog-cloud architecture. The proposed approach introduces a dynamic priority assignment mechanism that leverages real-time patient data for swift processing of critical events and an adaptive resource allocation strategy that optimizes performance under varying workloads. Simulations and real-world case studies demonstrate the framework’s superiority, achieving a 30% reduction in average response time for critical events and a 25% improvement in resource utilization compared to state-of-the-art methods. Contributions include: 1) a novel M/M/C/K priority queue model integrated with edge-fog-cloud architecture; 2) dynamic priority assignment and adaptive resource allocation strategies; and 3) comprehensive evaluation through simulations and case studies. By addressing key challenges in IoHT data processing and prioritization, this work enables the development of efficient, responsive, and reliable IoHT systems for timely and personalized healthcare interventions, ultimately improving patient outcomes and quality of care.},

The proposed system integrates wearable sensors, data analytics, and cloud computing to continuously monitor patients' vital signs, like body temperature, heartbeat, room temperature, and humidity. The collected data is transmitted in real-time to a centralized cloud platform, where advanced analytics detect anomalies and trigger alerts for healthcare providers. Sensor fusion technology is employed to combine data from multiple sensors, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of health monitoring across distributed locations. The system's architecture ensures secure and efficient data handling, maintaining patient privacy while facilitating timely medical interventions. Experimental results demonstrate the system's efficacy in promptly identifying critical health events and enabling rapid response, thereby improving patient outcomes, and reducing the burden on healthcare facilities. This IoT-driven HMS represents a significant advancement in telemedicine with an accuracy of 91.68 % and offers a scalable and reliable solution for continuous health monitoring and immediate medical assistance. A Proof of Concept (POC) of the IoT-based HMS is developed and tested to display real-world applications in healthcare facilities. The proposed system can also be integrated with a Decision Support System (DSS) to generate adequate medical reports for future use.}

abstract = {Remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) detects heartbeat-induced skin color changes via camera to extract the Blood Volume Pulse (BVP) signal, which helps measure vital signs like heart and respiratory rates. Despite its popularity in health research for its user-friendly and noninvasive approach, rPPG’s BVP signal quality can be compromised by factors like video compression. This research seeks to evaluate how various compression methods affect BVP signal quality, aiming to enhance rPPG’s practical use. We created the ZJXU-MOTION dataset to assess video compression’s impact on Blood Volume Pulse (BVP) signal quality during motion, considering activity and lighting. We compared common codecs like H.264, H.265, AV1/VP9, MJPEG, ProRes, and FFV1, analyzing how compression artifacts and bitrates influence BVP. Our results were confirmed with the UBFC-Phys dataset. Inter-frame compression can degrade BVP signal quality by adding noise. For clear signals, use intra-frame compression like H.265 with a GOP size of 1. If using inter-frame, keep GOP small and CQP stable. For static videos, H.265 CQP or VP9 VBR with GOP sizes of 1–3 work well. For low-motion videos, H.265 provides better performance. For complex motion, lossless compression methods like FFV1 outperform H.264 and H.265 in preserving BVP signal quality. Given that inter-frame compression introduces noise into BVP processing, we recommend intra-frame compression – particularly H.265 with a GOP of 1 – for optimal signal extraction. For complex motion, H.265 and FFV1 offer robust solutions, with FFV1 being especially effective in high-motion conditions. These findings are instrumental for advancing rPPG technology in health monitoring and diagnostics.}

abstract = {Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) combines wireless communication and distributed processing technology, and is widely used in military, precision agriculture, medical, environmental monitoring, and intelligent transportation, especially in patient data collection, mobile monitoring, and real-time monitoring. However, WSN faces patient information security issues in medical applications. This article proposes a WSN group encryption algorithm based on chaos theory and performs data compression. The article briefly introduces the concept, characteristics, and security threats of WSN, and elaborates on the basic theory of chaotic encryption technology and its differences from traditional cryptography. In response to the problems of medical information leakage and insufficient existing encryption algorithms, we propose a chaotic block encryption algorithm using the Feistel structure. By using integer chaotic mapping and introducing long period random sequences for XOR operation, we solve the short period problem, improve security, and save energy. In addition, a data compression algorithm based on regression models was designed to address the characteristics of large data volume, high redundancy, and strong real-time performance in medical monitoring. By dynamically adjusting the sampling time and regression model parameters, the compressed data is closer to actual changes, significantly improving compression performance and extending network lifespan. Prioritize vital sign data based on its importance to ensure real-time data transmission. The chaotic encryption algorithm proposed in the experiment has good confusion and diffusion characteristics, which can effectively protect the security of patient data. The compression algorithm reduces data redundancy and WSN node energy consumption, achieving remote monitoring of patient vital signs, enabling doctors to timely grasp the condition and formulate treatment plans. Priority setting ensures rapid transmission of emergency data and earns valuable treatment time for patients.}

abstract = {Smart cities and healthcare services have been gaining much attention in recent years, as the benefits offered by this field of research are significant and improve quality of life. Systems can proactively detect health problems by monitoring a person’s vital signs and make automated decisions to prevent these problems from worsening. With this in mind, we highlight two essential requirements that smart city architectures should consider to achieve elevated quality of experience in the healthcare domain. The first is to process high-priority vital signs with short response times, so people with comorbidities can have health problems identified as soon as possible. The second is to employ scalability techniques to deal with high usage peaks resulting from people concentrating in specific city neighborhoods. This paper contributes to this field of research by proposing SmartVSO - a computational model of a hierarchic, scalable, tree-based, fog-cloud architecture that executes healthcare services with reduced response time for urgent vital signs. Fog computing is employed to reduce response times, and cloud computing is used to provide virtually infinite computing resources. Serverless computing is the main technology we consider for deploying and running healthcare services because this allows authorized companies to implement their own services in a distributed and pluggable approach, without recompiling the proposed modules and reducing scalability concerns for engineers. An experiment with 80,000 vital signs indicates that our solution processes 60% of the very critical ones in no more than 5.3 s, while an architecture without fog computing and without prioritization takes up to 231 min (around 3 h and 51 min) to process 60% of very critical vital signs.}

abstract = {In the era of communicational technologies, body area networks (BAN) provide useful and applicable devices for monitoring soldiers' health, of paramount importance for the governments and countries' security. However, BANs face two main challenges of security and energy, due to limitations in energy, memory, and process of the utilized sensors. Despite the developments of many solutions to tackle the stated challenges, the simultaneous consideration of energy and security has been overlooked in the majority of them. Besides, in some of the recommended solutions, the energy consumption is not optimum, resulting from discarding information content in data sampling. In addition, another group of the current methods is not practical, not guaranteeing security, given the high computational costs and the entropic inefficiency of encryption keys. Therefore, in the present study, a lightweight and secure sensing model is recommended for BANs, applicable in biological warfare. In the proposed model, the data are sampled according to their entropies, then compressed and encrypted simultaneously considering their sparsity levels, aiming at reducing energy consumption and boosting security. To synchronize two functions of compression and encryption, a measurement matrix, a type of sub-Gaussian matrix, is used. Furthermore, the biological data associated with the under-care soldier is encrypted using a key, guaranteeing the secure transfer of data to the smart healthcare center. In this process, the key is generated from the time interval calculated from the heart rate of the under-care soldier. The simulation data reveal that the proposed sensing model causes a reduction in energy consumption while providing security, compared to the previous methods.}

abstract = {Fog Computing extends the Cloud Computing paradigm to the edge of the network, thus enabling a new breed of applications and services. Defining characteristics of the Fog are: a) Low latency and location awareness; b) Wide-spread geographical distribution; c) Mobility; d) Very large number of nodes, e) Predominant role of wireless access, f) Strong presence of streaming and real time applications, g) Heterogeneity. In this paper we argue that the above characteristics make the Fog the appropriate platform for a number of critical Internet of Things (IoT) services and applications, namely, Connected Vehicle, Smart Grid, Smart Cities, and, in general, Wireless Sensors and Actuators Networks (WSANs).},
